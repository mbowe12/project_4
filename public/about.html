                <h1>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have released 26 albums in 11 years.</h1>
                <p>That’s only counting albums they have released as KGLW, as members of the band are also involved in various other
                projects. That’s a LOT of output.</p>
                <p>More often than not, the band also experiments with new sounds each album. So if you aren’t a fan of the most recent
                release there could be a new album around the corner that might be right up your alley.</p>
